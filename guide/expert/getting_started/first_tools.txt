§2§lYour First Tools

At first you punch trees make a crafting table, and make those first wooden tools.  
A couple of catches however, first each log will only make 2 planks! And that first wooden pickaxe will only mine 6 blocks!

The stone tools are the last vanilla tools that have any use.  From this point on you will need to get into Tinkers Construct to get higher tools of any use.
